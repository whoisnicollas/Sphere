# Sphere

This is my first non-academic project, so I wanted it to be something simple yet well-executed. I created its design in Figma and adjusted and reorganized the content based on my learnings in HTML and CSS.
## Color documentation

For my first project, I wanted to do it in a color that I like, so I chose some shades of purple.

| Color              | Hexadecimal                                                |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Medium-dark purple       | ![#240046](https://via.placeholder.com/10/240046?text=+) #240046 |
| Medium-light purple       | ![#19053d](https://via.placeholder.com/10/19053d?text=+) #19053d |
| Medium purple       | ![#3c096c](https://via.placeholder.com/10/3c096c?text=+) #3c096c |
| Light purple      | ![#7b2cbf](https://via.placeholder.com/10/7b2cbf?text=+) #7b2cbf |
| Dark purple (only used on Scrollbar)     | ![#10002b](https://via.placeholder.com/10/10002b?text=+) #10002b |
